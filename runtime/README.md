# Allies runtime proof

`allies-runtime` is a small, independently packaged process for the FND-004
tenant topology. It calls Hermes only over authenticated loopback HTTP and
does not own a database or write the Hermes volume.

The image entrypoint uses `--serve` so the runtime remains the container's
PID 1. The proof harness is an explicit command:

Run the deterministic local proof from a clean repository checkout root:

```powershell
uv --directory runtime run --locked pytest --cov=allies_runtime --cov-report=term-missing
uv --directory runtime run --locked python -m allies_runtime --smoke fake
```

`--smoke live` is opt-in (`FND004_LIVE_SMOKE=1`) and still requires the
provider/lifecycle capability and secure temporary-profile bootstrap owned by
the live proof. The backend adapter is documented in
`docs/operations/hermes-runtime-smoke.md`. Without that gate it fails closed
and creates no resources. A live bootstrap prepares its socket/material seam
before provisioning, then installs temporary Hermes profiles within a bounded
timeout and confirms authenticated readiness before Foundry writes the durable
Workspace binding. Profile streams run only after that gate.

Configuration accepts an opaque `HERMES_CREDENTIAL_REF` only. The resolver
passed to `HermesClient` is responsible for retrieving a short-lived value;
the image's default resolver asks the secure workload-local Unix socket at
`/run/allies-runtime/hermes-credential.sock` (override with
`HERMES_CREDENTIAL_SOCKET`). The value is never placed in settings, payloads,
exceptions, or evidence. The socket/bootstrap is an explicit live-proof
dependency; a proof-only `test://fnd004/…` reference may instead use the
deterministic fixture resolver and needs no socket producer. This bootstrap
credential is separate from the profile-local chat credentials materialized by
the FND-006 profile lifecycle.

Production profile turns do not use the bootstrap credential. Runtime
composition reads `API_SERVER_KEY` only from the claimed materialized profile's
mode-0600 `.env`, then uses that key for session create, exact conflict
inspection, and streaming. The first turn derives separate stable opaque values
for the Hermes session candidate and `X-Hermes-Session-Key`; later turns resume
the session ID supplied by Foundry.

## Foundry worker boundary

`allies_runtime.foundry.FoundryClient` calls the internal
`/api/v1/runtime/` contract with `Authorization: Bearer <runtime-token>` and,
for Attempt mutations, `X-Foundry-Lease-Token: <lease-token>`. Tokens remain in
process memory and are never included in errors or evidence. `FoundryWorker`
keeps a bounded pool (the proof uses two slots), serializes work through
Foundry's per-profile lease, and forwards normalized Hermes events as they
arrive. Event
IDs are deterministic from Attempt, stream, and sequence so response loss is
safe to replay with the same claim or mutation identity.

Before contacting Hermes, the worker confirms `execution.dispatched`. It then
stores only bounded `message.delta`, `activity.started`, and
`activity.completed` payloads. A valid `run.completed` followed by `done`
provides the effective session ID. The worker compare-and-sets that ID before
asking Foundry to append `execution.completed` and complete the attempt in one
transaction. Failure uses the matching atomic `execution.failed` transition.
After dispatch, cancellation, fencing, lease loss, or an ambiguous response is
unknown-safe and is never automatically requeued.

Renewal runs every 20 seconds against the 60-second lease contract. A renewal
failure cancels the incremental Hermes stream immediately, sends `stopped`,
and suppresses later event/terminal writes. The client maps `401`, `409`,
`422`, `429`, and `503` responses to typed errors; a lost claim response keeps
the same `claim_id` reserved until the replay succeeds.

Runtime-authored events use sequences through 100000. Sequence 100001 is
reserved for the nonretryable `event_budget_exhausted` terminal event; the
worker closes Hermes before sending it and never starts a replacement
execution.
If both identical failure requests lose their responses, the worker leaves
the lease unresolved. A committed failure is already terminal; otherwise
claim-time lease expiry publishes one nonretryable `lease_expired` terminal
at the reserved sequence, without replaying the execution.

## Managed reasoning effort

Foundry supplies the optional `reasoning_effort` claim metadata for
Allies-originated turns. The initial setting is `xhigh`, configured with
`ALLIES_RUNTIME_REASONING_EFFORT`; the only accepted values are `high` and
`xhigh`. Foundry validates the setting at startup and samples it when each
claim response is built. A replay before dispatch may therefore use the value
from the current process configuration, while a dispatched turn keeps the
value carried by its claim until completion.

The runtime forwards a present value to Hermes as
`model_options.reasoning={"enabled":true,"effort":"<value>"}` on both
buffered and incremental session streams, including existing sessions. A
claim without this optional field keeps the legacy request body. Invalid
present values fail before the Hermes request. The managed request value
intentionally takes precedence for the turn; profile settings remain stored
and are not rewritten or rematerialized. Session creation continues to use
the profile's existing model, currently `openai/gpt-6-luna` via OpenRouter.

After a compatible `allies-runtime` image is adopted, changing the Foundry
setting and reloading Foundry processes updates later turns without rebuilding
the runtime image or changing profiles. Older runtime images ignore the new
claim field, so they must be replaced before existing Allies receive managed
reasoning. Restore the prior accepted value and reload Foundry to roll back
future turns; in-flight turns retain their sampled effort.

## Approval rollout

Approval consumers must be compatible before the producer is enabled: deploy
Cloud, Foundry, and Interface support first, then publish the derived Hermes
and `allies-runtime` images together. Existing profile and bootstrap
credential references are reused; no credential migration is part of this
rollout. Rich approval production is enabled by default. Foundry-managed activation
and image replacement carry the same `ALLIES_RICH_APPROVALS_ENABLED` setting
into the runtime container. Set it to `false` in the Foundry environment to
disable production; do not mutate individual Machines. The setting is read
when an adoption or replacement spec is built and applies to newly managed
Machines.

An approval already pending in an older image cannot be resumed
automatically. Ask for a new live approval request after the compatible image
is running; the runtime never replays a tool call or carries an old consent
across that boundary.

Foundry delivery retains the canonical event source for repair. After eight
retryable attempts it rebuilds and verifies the envelope, reuses
`PENDING` after a 300-second delay, and fences callbacks with the repair cycle
and attempt. Three automatic repair cycles are bounded. The
`redrive_event_deliveries` management command validates selected delivery or
event IDs without changing state; `--confirm` is required to redrive an
exhausted row.

Idle claim polling starts at one second and grows exponentially through 2, 4,
8, and 10 seconds with bounded jitter. When reconciliation materializes one or
more profiles, successful empty claims use the one-second minimum for eight
polls before normal idle backoff resumes. A claimed execution or a recovered
retryable claim response resets the delay; active slots refill immediately when
work completes. Readiness probing still uses its separate startup retry loop.
