# Machine replacement continuity proof

Use this runbook to execute FND-008 against Fly. The command creates one owned
workspace, runs two isolated conversations, replaces the Machine while two
streams are active, verifies the generation fence and session continuity, then
removes the proof resources.

The command has no fake mode. Local deterministic coverage runs through the
service test suite.

## Before you run it

Confirm all of the following:

- `fly.exe auth whoami` succeeds with access to the target organization.
- The runtime image is published by immutable digest and contains the FND-008
  worker entrypoint.
- Foundry is deployed at a public HTTPS origin that Fly Machines can reach.
- The runtime image can resolve the supplied Hermes and profile credential
  references. The command requires an explicit confirmation flag because it
  cannot inspect that resolver without reading credentials.
- Fly multi-container Machines and runtime-container file secrets are available
  for the target account.
- The evidence output file does not already exist. Its parent directory must be
  writable.

Set the two capability gates for the current terminal:

```powershell
$env:FLY_MULTI_CONTAINER_ENABLED = "1"
$env:FLY_FILE_SECRETS_ENABLED = "1"
```

These flags are assertions about capabilities you have verified. They do not
enable a Fly feature by themselves.

## Run the proof

Replace every angle-bracket value. Credential arguments are opaque references,
not secret values.

```powershell
Set-Location backend

uv run --locked python manage.py prove_machine_continuity `
  --live `
  --confirm-runtime-credential-resolver `
  --runtime-image "<registry/runtime@sha256:digest>" `
  --foundry-origin "https://<foundry-host>" `
  --hermes-credential-ref "<opaque-reference>" `
  --profile-a-credential-ref "<opaque-reference>" `
  --profile-b-credential-ref "<opaque-reference>" `
  --model "<model-name>" `
  --organization "<fly-organization>" `
  --region "ams" `
  --output "<absolute-path>/fnd-008-evidence.json"
```

The runtime bearer is generated per Machine generation. It is staged to Fly
through stdin, mounted only in the runtime container as a file, retained in
memory for the fence check, and revoked during cleanup. It is never written to
the evidence file or Machine configuration.

## Interpret the result

The command always writes sanitized JSON when the output path is valid.

| Exit | Status | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | `pass` | Every required continuity check passed and cleanup completed. |
| `1` | `fail` | The proof mutated resources and a required check failed. |
| `2` | `skipped` | Preflight failed before provider mutation. |
| `3` | `incomplete_cleanup` | Cleanup failed. This takes precedence over proof failures. |

A passing report must show:

- generation 1 and generation 2 Machine IDs with one stable Volume ID;
- two proof-held generation 1 executions fenced without replay;
- the same-profile queued turn starting only on generation 2;
- both profiles reconciled and resumed on generation 2;
- isolated session continuity for Ally A and Ally B;
- `cleanup: complete`.

## Failure and rerun

Do not rerun with the same output path. Read the final check's safe detail code,
verify cleanup, correct the failing prerequisite, and choose a new output file.

For `incomplete_cleanup`, inspect the owned App named in `resources.app` before
removing anything. Delete only IDs recorded in the evidence. Do not use a broad
organization cleanup command.

After a passing live run, retain the sanitized evidence and recording in the
approved project location, then update Nabu with the result and the Milestone 2
estimate. Raw terminal logs are not committed by default.
